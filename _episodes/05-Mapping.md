exercises: 15
questions:
- "What does pseudo alignment means?"
- "What is the advantage of pseudi alignment?"
- "What is the difference of UMI dataset with other sequencing datasets?"
- "Which packages can be useful for mapping UMI datasets?"
objectives:
- "Explain the concept of pseudo alignment"
- "To understand difference between UMI and no-UMI datasets"
keypoints:
- "There are two types of datasets in scRNA-seq processing."
- "Data sets with no-UMI are mapped normally like the bulk RNA-seq large datasets."
- "Datasets with UMI are mapped in two steps including features counting and UMI tools."

The important point dealing with scRNA-seq data is to understand the difference between UMI and no-UMI datasets. This makes it aeasy to deal with each type of dataset.
