# scRNA-Seq Experimental Workflow

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a novel technique for extracting more detailed information from genome.
Technically, scRNA-seq includes two parts of experimental design and data analysis.
As it was mentioned before, scRNA-seq is useful in case of heterogeniety of cells and developmental studies. For example,
imagine brain tissue with tens of cell types with tens of different expression profiles. For extracting transcriptome
of each cell, it is necessary to isolate each cell from the tissue properly.

> A challange in experiment design of scRNA-seq is to isolate cells and prepare a comprehensive library.
