# Cleaning Reads

In the previous episode, we took a high-level look at the quality
of each of our samples using FastQC. We visualized per-base quality
graphs showing the distribution of read quality at each base across
all reads in a sample and extracted information about which samples
fail which quality checks. Some of our samples failed quite a few quality metrics used by FastQC. This doesn't mean,
though, that our samples should be thrown out! It's very common to have some quality metrics fail, and this may or may not be a problem for your downstream application. For our variant calling workflow, we will be removing some of the low quality sequences to reduce our false positive rate due to sequencing error.

We will use a program called
[Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) to
filter poor quality reads and trim poor quality bases from our samples.

## Trimmomatic Options

Trimmomatic has a variety of options to trim your reads. If we run the following command, we can see some of our options.
