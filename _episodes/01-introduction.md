RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) is a technique that can examine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Compared to previous Sanger sequencing- and microarray-based methods, RNA-Seq provides far higher coverage and greater resolution of the dynamic nature of the transcriptome. Beyond quantifying gene expression, the data generated by RNA-Seq facilitate the discovery of novel transcripts, identification of alternatively spliced genes, and detection of allele-specific expression.

In order to perform RNA-seq studies, samples have to be lysed, and the RNA is extracted. The following steps involve converting a sample of RNA to a cDNA library, which is then sequenced and mapped against a reference genome. The original goal of RNA sequencing was to compare the actual transcript abundance between samples.

### Pitfall of RNA-seq
- Insufficient for studying heterogeneous systems, e.g. early development studies, complex tissues (brain)
- Does not provide insights into the stochastic nature of gene expression
Therefore, scRNA-seq was introduced to overcome the limitation of bulk RNA-seq. 

## Introduction to scRNA-seq

The main difference between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq is that each sequencing library represents a single cell, instead of a population of cells.

The main advantage of scRNA-seq is that the cellular resolution and the genome-wide scope make it possible to address intractable issues using other methods, e.g. bulk RNA-seq or single-cell RT-qPCR. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required, and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.
